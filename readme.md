# Arithmetic Operators Lab

# Description
This lab is designed to help you practice basic and advanced arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

## Completing the Lab

Open the `arithmetic-functions.js` file and ensure the below tasks are completed so that the test cases pass. The file can be found under the `src/main/java/com/revature` package.

Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Implement the add() function
- [ ] Implement the subtract() function
- [ ] Implement the multiply() function
- [ ] Implement the divide() function
- [ ] Implement the modulus() function
- [ ] Implement the exponentiate() function

## Running Tests

- To run the tests, click on the `test beaker` icon and run the test cases.
- To run the program for manual testing, you can call any of the functions you've implemented. Call these functions within the `index.js` file's App object's `start()` method. Run the program using the following command: `node src/main/java/com/revature/index.js` 

Below is an example of manually testing the `add()` function:
